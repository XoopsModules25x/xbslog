Installation notes for XBS Logger System
----------------------------------------

What does it do?
----------------
XBS Logger is a Xoops module that implements an application logging
capability for other Xoops modules.  In common with many
XBS modules, it is not meant to be used by itself but provides generic
capabilities that many applications can use.  The module does provide
an administrative interface so that you can see and delete log entries.
This means the developer does not need to do this themself. A relatively
simple set of configuration options are also provided.

Release Notes
-------------
V1RC1 Mar 30 2006 - Initial release


Prerequisites
-------------
Xoops >= V2.0.13
Xoops V2.2 will work although you may experience some weirdness in the
display of the admin menus etc.

PHP >= 4.3.10.  Versions prior to this do not support the %F attribute to
sprintf() and therefore logs cannot be read from disk into database and
therefore are not displayed.

Installation
------------
1/ Extract archive to your Xoops module directory.  Ensure that you install
into the xbs_log subdirectory (default behavour).

2/ Use Xoops module installation as usual.  Take careful note of the
installation messages.  If it says something like the install script failed
then this is because there is a permissioning problem on your XOOPS_ROOT_PATH.
The installation directory attempts to create a directory XOOPS_ROOT_PATH/log.
Install script failure message indicates that it is not able to do this.  Create
the directory yourself and make sure it is owned by the user that is running
your web server (typically apache or nobody on *nix systems.)
You can also set the directory permissions to read/write and execute for owner
only (0700 for *nix).

Unfortunately Xoops does not show user error messages from the
install/deinstall/update scripts yet so that's why you are being told here!

3/ Point your browser at XOOPS_ROOT_PATH/modules/xbs_log/test.php
This should create some log entries.  Check that you can see the file using
your file browser (you may need to set permissions on the log directory/file
to do this.)  Now go to XBS Logger administration (Log menu option).  You
should see the logged records.  This means they have been transfered to the database.
You can additionally check that the log file is now empty.

You're good to go.


Using the system
----------------
Check out the test.php and header.php files (you can delete them once you are
satisfied that the system works).  It demonstrates how to use the logger
quite simply.

Back in the Logger admin panel, click on the 'Module Documentation' option
to see the developers documentation for the system.

The module configuration (preferences) screen allows you to chaneg three parameters:

1 - The log directory.  Default is XOOPS_ROOT_PATH/log
If you change this you a/ need to create it first and b/ give r/w/x permission
to the username running your web server.

2 - The log file. Change the name if you don't like the default name.

3 - Date format.  This is the format string passed to the php date() function
used to display date/time information on teh log entry admin screen.  Please note
that whatever format you use, the microsecond part is *always* suffixed to the
date-time string.

How it works
------------
Writing to the log, writes the info out to a disk file.  During testing of the
concept, I found that trying to do writes to the database in tight loops was
impractical.

When you read the log (i.e. view it in Logger admin,) the contents of the log
disk file are read into the database permanent store and the disk file is truncated.

You can empty the disk storage as an option from the log admin screen.

If you are not going to manually read the log you should set up some sort of cron
job that utilises the LoggerHandler class (e.g. $myLogger->readLogToDB()) to read the disk file periodically.
(NB, or you could wait for the next XBS module which is an event scheduler !)

Provision to GPL License V2
---------------------------
As part of your usage of this module you agree that installations and uninstalls
are registered with the code owner.

You can do everything that the GPL says you can except:
- Remove the xbsnotice.php script
- Remove the lines in defines.php that includes/requires xbsnotice.php
- Amend xbsnotice.php

Why?

Because, whilst I don't really care about how you use this software I am
interested in where it is being used.  The xbsnotice script attempts to
send a message to my home server when the software is installed or
uninstalled.  This simply tells me what server it is installed on.

Why am I telling you this instead of obscuring it?

It's just better that way.  Hopefully you will agree and not go dumping the
code.  The other reason is that it is the start of another XBS utility that
will eventually be made available to Xoopsters and this is a good way of
testing it.
